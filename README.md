This module takes last_name and first_name fields and downloads all PubMed entries for that name. It puts the PubMed entries into another REDCap field. It also requires one helper text field. It checks PubMed once a day for new entries. Because of inaccuracies of the process, it is recommended that human eyes manually oversee the download process.
